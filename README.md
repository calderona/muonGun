Step0 is the GEN-SIM

Step1 is the GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW

Step2 is the GEN-SIM-RECO, but also is produces directly the MINIAODSIM and DQMIO, since is the standard sequence that is use for producing relVal samples. ---> so here is the RECO step where the alignment should be included. 

Step3 is only to get final DQM files (HARVESTING)
